# üìö Embedded System Concepts: A Learning Hub

This repository serves as a central hub for my ongoing embedded systems learning journey. It features a curated collection of **code examples**, **mini-projects**, and **development setups** tailored for various **microcontrollers**. The aim is to solidify understanding of fundamental embedded concepts through practical application and hands-on coding.

## üöÄ Purpose of This Repository

As an Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student, mastering embedded systems involves a blend of hardware understanding and software development. This repository is my personal workspace and showcase for:

* **Core Concept Reinforcement:** Practical implementations of essential embedded concepts like GPIO control, timers, interrupts, communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C), ADC, PWM, etc.
* **Microcontroller Exploration:** Learning to program different microcontroller architectures (e.g., AVR, ARM Cortex-M) beyond high-level abstractions.
* **Bare-metal Programming:** Developing an understanding of how code interacts directly with hardware registers.
* **Build System Mastery:** Utilizing **Makefiles** for efficient, command-line based compilation and flashing, moving beyond IDE dependence.
* **Project-Based Learning:** Small, focused projects to apply theoretical knowledge in a tangible way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies & Areas Covered

* **Embedded Systems Fundamentals:** Memory management, real-time operating systems (RTOS concepts), low-power design, bootloaders.
* **Microcontrollers:** Focus on **AVR** (e.g., Arduino Uno's ATmega328P) and potentially **ARM Cortex-M** (e.g., STM32) in future explorations.
* **Programming Languages:** Primarily **C** and **C++** for embedded development.
* **Build Automation:** **Makefiles** for configuring compilation flags, linking libraries, and flashing firmware using tools like **AVR-GCC** and **AVRDUDE**.
* **Hardware Interfacing:** Code examples for interacting with various peripherals.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation through different topics or microcontroller platforms. You will typically find directories structured by:

* **Microcontroller Platform:** E.g., `AVR_ArduinoUno`, `STM32_BluePill`.
* **Concept/Module:** E.g., `GPIO_LED_Blink`, `UART_Communication`, `Timer_Interrupts`.

Each module or project directory will typically contain:

* `.c` / `.cpp` files: Source code for the embedded application.
* `.h` files: Header files for functions, definitions, etc.
* `Makefile`: A custom **Makefile** for compiling and flashing the code for that specific example/project.
* `README.md` (or `NOTES.md`): A brief description, circuit diagrams (if applicable), and instructions for that specific example.
* `Output/` (or `build/`): Directory for compiled `.hex`, `.elf`, or `.bin` files.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started / How to Use

To explore and run the code examples:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahrufhossain/embedded_system_concepts.git
    cd embedded_system_concepts
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific example:** Choose a project (e.g., `AVR_ArduinoUno/01_GPIO_Blink`).
3.  **Review the `README.md`:** Each example should have its own `README.md` or `NOTES.md` detailing specific hardware setups, dependencies, and instructions.
4.  **Ensure Toolchain & Tools:** Make sure you have the necessary cross-compilers (**AVR-GCC**, ARM-GCC if applicable), **`avrdude`**, and the **`make`** utility installed on your system.
5.  **Configure Makefile:** You will likely need to adjust variables like `PORT`, `ARDUINO_PATH` (for AVR projects), or specific toolchain paths within the example's `Makefile` to match your development environment.
6.  **Build & Flash:** Use the `make` commands specified in the individual example's `Makefile` (e.g., `make upload`).

## ü§ù Contribution & Learning
